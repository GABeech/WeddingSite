Title: How We Met
---
**George and Sara** met one fateful night in fall 2012 at an Upper East Side bar in NYC.  

Our mutual friend and groomsmen, Daryl introduced us. We spent the night bonding over a mutual hatred of Canadian bacon (it’s not real bacon—eh!) and a shared love of ice cream cake. 

George will tell you that I wouldn’t give him the time of day at first; however, my story is that I have tendency to start to respond to a text, get distracted by something (squirrel!) and forget to respond, or my phone is on silent or do not disturb.

I did eventually respond, and after five years and many adventures together, we can’t wait to embark on a new chapter as husband and wife.
